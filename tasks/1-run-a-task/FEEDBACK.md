### Feedback:

#### JS SDK Docs

[

Could you find the necessary information? If not what topics were difficult to find? 

In the "Helpful resources" it was says : The fortune command is available in the /usr/games directory.
I used this directory but I alway recived this error

"Error: Command failed: /usr/games/fortune -i
/bin/sh: /usr/games/fortune: No such file or directory"

How would you change the structure/navigation of the docs? Recommend changes.

Are examples and tutorials useful? What was missing, and what was too detailed or unnecessary?

Have you noticed any errors? Please describe them or provide links to issues if you have already reported them.

"Error: Command failed: /usr/games/fortune -i
/bin/sh: /usr/games/fortune: No such file or directory"

Is the hash right?

#### JS golem-js

[
    
Is JS SDK API intuitive and helps solve the tasks? If not, what would you change?

Have you encountered any errors in the golem-js lib? Provide the link(s) to the issue(s) in `golem-js` [repository](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-js/issues) which you had reported.

What additional features would you add?

#### General feedback:

[

What was your general experience with Golem Network? What was difficult/frustrating? 

For the first time it is difficult to understand how to write code correctly. But I think if I have more practice it will be much easier.

What was a nice surprise?

In what projects could you utilize Golem Network?

Is there anything you would improve about the JS Preview program?
