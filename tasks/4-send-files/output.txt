JS Task API Examples: executing tasks ©

Introduction ©

With Golem JS Task API you can execute just a single task on a single provider or a series of multiple
tasks in parallel on many providers. In the case of the latter, you can additionally define how providers
should be initialized and how many tasks you want to run simultaneously.

In this article, the following examples are presented:

e Running tasks in parallel (map())

e Running tasks in parallel (forEach())

e Defining the number of providers working in parallel
e Initializing providers

e Running a single task
